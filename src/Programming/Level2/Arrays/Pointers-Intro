Pointers in C

-- When a variable is declared, the "compiler" maintains a lookup table that stores the information
    -- Ex : int a = 5;
        Lookup table stores the following
            a   int   Starting address of a

-- In C and C++ its possible to access the address where the variable is stored
    -- int a = 5;
        int *p = &a;
        Here p is a pointer to a.
        Print(&a) = address of a;
        Print(p) = same as above
        Print(*p) = 5;
        *p = 8;
        Print(a) = 8;
