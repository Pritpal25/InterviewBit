Sorting : Arranging homogenous elements of a collection in a specific order of rank.

Sorting Algos can be classigied on the following parameters
1. Time Complexity.
2. Space Complexity
    In place, constant memory
    Memory Usage grows with size of input.
3. Stability
    The order of the elements with the same rank doesnt change in the output.
4. Internal vs External Sort
    When all the elements that need to be sorted are in main memory - internal
    When some or all the elements that need to be sorted are in disk/tape - external
5. Recursive/Non Recursive
